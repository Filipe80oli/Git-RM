This repository manager provides a user-friendly interface for cloning Git branches. Key features include:

Cloning: Easily clone any branch from a Git repository by entering its URL.
Branch selection: Browse and select the specific branch you want to clone.
Destination selection: Choose the local directory where you want to save the cloned repository.
Favorites management: Add, remove, or update frequently used repositories for quick access.
This project was developed using Python and PyQt5. I'm open to suggestions for improvement.
